# Olga's Project progress
## ERD
Seven tables were created based on the datasets that the group has selected for the final project. The ERD was created and the tables were loaded into the PostgreSQL. The database is shared via AWS. 

## Machine Learning
I worked on the Logistic Regression, SVM and Decision Tree Classifier.
