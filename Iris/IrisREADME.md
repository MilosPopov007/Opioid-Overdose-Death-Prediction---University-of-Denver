## Selected Topic and Reasoning

Our group has decided to investigate the topic of the opioid epidemic in the United States. Our aim is to predict the levels of opioid overdoses in a county based on socio-economic variables including education level, personal income, poverty, unemployment rates, and the dispensing rate of opioid prescriptions.

As the deaths caused by opioid overdoses continue to rise, we believe that uncovering the county-level variables that correlate most closely to high levels of opioid deaths will be a useful endeavor. The results of this research will potentially allow researchers to predict which counties will suffer the most from opioid overdoses, and consequently allow policy makers to allocate the necessary resources to these counties. 

## Description of the Data

### Death by Opioid Type:
https://wonder.cdc.gov/
The mortality data are based on information from all death certificates filed in the fifty states
all sub-national data representing zero to nine (0-9) deaths are suppressed.

601 counties had the minimum mortality rate to be represented for analysis and were pulled from the WONDER database. These were the recommended codes to use when relating to Opioid deaths provided by the CDC.

Type of death:
T40.0 (Opium) – No county reached the number of deaths above 9 per year to not be suppressed when finding specific cause
T40.1 (Heroin)
T40.2 (Other opioids)
T40.3 (Methadone)
T40.4 (Other synthetic narcotics)
From the CDC Wonder Database.
Type of death by county will not add up to total mortality due to the fact that low death rate of a county was withheld from data to protect privacy of individuals.

### Education:
https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/county-level-data-sets/county-level-data-sets-download-data/
Educational attainment for adults age 25 and older for the U.S., States, and counties, 1970-2021

Categories consist of:
Less than Highschool Diploma
High School Diploma Only
Some College or Associate’s Degree
Bachelor’s Degree or Higher

### Unemployment:
https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/county-level-data-sets/county-level-data-sets-download-data/
Unemployment and median household income for the U.S., States, and counties, 2000-2021

Data consists of:
Civilian Labor Force
number of Employed
number  of Unemployed
Unemployment Rate

### Personal Income:
https://www.bea.gov/data/income-saving/personal-income
Personal income by county and metropolitan area. From all sources, not just wages and salaries. Includes government social benefits, such as unemployment insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security ,and pandemic-related payments.

### Dispensing Rate:
https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/rxrate-maps/county2020.html

U.S. County Opioid Dispensing Rates. Prescriptions are based on the location of the prescriber, rather than the location of the pharmacy.

## Project Questions

Can we predict the rate of opioid overdose deaths by county based on basic socio-economic variables AND the dispensing rate of prescription opioids for that county?

Which of the selected factors contribute the most to our prediction for rate of opioid deaths?

### Exploratory Data Analysis Questions:

What is the trajectory of opioid deaths in the counties that we have focused on over the course of X years?

What is the correlation (if any) of opioid deaths to education (income/poverty/unemployment/prescription rate) in the counties we have chosen?

Which of our independent variables shows the strongest correlation to overdose deaths?

Which form of opioid is responsible for the most deaths in the counties we have chosen?
